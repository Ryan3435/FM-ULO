Attached below are the undelivered and delivered orders that are included in the September 2008 Top Dollar ULO review.

<p><i>PBS is once again committed to reviewing 100% of undelivered orders with balances greater than $15 million and delivered orders with balances greater than $750,000 as of September 2008, to ensure these are stated accurately on our books.  Unliquidated Obligations (ULOs) that meet this threshold, please provide all supporting documentation.  Please note, if you have an item that was in the July sample, you will only need to provide documentation for activity that happened (both contract documentation and receiving reports) from August 1st through October 6th.</i></p>
<br />
<p>Remember, if you have a ULO on your list that was in the July sample (see column 'Category' on all data tab), you will only need to provide documentation that happened from August 1st through October 6th.  Also, you will not need to provide a signed validation for each item listed because of the short turnaround time of this request.</p>
<br />
<p><b>If your delivered order balance is due to an FY08 construction estimated accrual, we will need an email statement from the project manager saying the amount that was accrued represents, to the best of their knowledge, the percentage of work completed through 2008.</b></p>
